# Steps for Implementing Chunk 1.2: Build a Minimal Recipe CRUD (Vertical Slice)

This document breaks down Chunk 1.2 from the Ice Cream Recipes project blueprint into smaller, testable steps. Each step builds on the previous ones to ultimately deliver a minimal CRUD implementation for recipes and sources.

## Backend Steps

### Step B1: Create Source and Recipe Models

1. Create the Source model with name and has_page_numbers attributes
2. Create the Recipe model with basic attributes: Name, Source ID, Page Number (optional), and Preparation Time
3. Set up the relationship between Recipe and Source models

**Testing Exit Criteria:**

- Write unit tests for the Source model that validate:
  - A Source can be created with a name and has_page_numbers flag
  - Source properties are correctly saved and retrieved
- Write unit tests for the Recipe model that validate:
  - A Recipe can be created with name, source ID, page number, and preparation time
  - Recipe properties are correctly saved and retrieved
  - The relationship between Recipe and Source works as expected

### Step B2: Scaffold ASP.NET Core Project and Database Context

1. Create an ASP.NET Core Web API project with proper structure
2. Set up the DbContext for PostgreSQL with configurations for Source and Recipe models
3. Configure the connection string for PostgreSQL

**Testing Exit Criteria:**

- Ensure the project builds without errors
- Manually test that the application can start successfully
- Verify PostgreSQL connection settings work by attempting to connect to the database

### Step B3: Implement GET and POST Endpoints for Sources

1. Create a Source controller with GET and POST endpoints
2. Implement data transfer objects (DTOs) for Source
3. Add input validation for the POST endpoint

**Testing Exit Criteria:**

- Write unit tests for the source controller that verify:
  - GET endpoint returns the list of sources
  - POST endpoint creates a new source with valid input
  - POST endpoint returns appropriate error responses for invalid input
- Manually test the endpoints using a tool like Postman or Swagger

### Step B4: Implement GET and POST Endpoints for Recipes

1. Create a Recipe controller with GET and POST endpoints
2. Implement data transfer objects (DTOs) for Recipe
3. Add input validation for the POST endpoint, including validation for source reference

**Testing Exit Criteria:**

- Write unit tests for the recipe controller that verify:
  - GET endpoint returns the list of recipes with their associated sources
  - POST endpoint creates a new recipe with valid input
  - POST endpoint returns appropriate error responses for invalid input
- Manually test the endpoints using a tool like Postman or Swagger

### Step B5: Create Database Migrations

1. Create initial migration for Source and Recipe tables
2. Ensure proper foreign key constraints between Recipe and Source tables
3. Apply the migrations to create the database schema

**Testing Exit Criteria:**

- Verify that migrations work correctly by applying them to a test database
- Check that the generated tables have the correct structure using a database tool
- Validate that creating a recipe with a non-existent source ID fails due to foreign key constraints

## Frontend Steps

### Step F1: Scaffold a New React Application

1. Create a new React application using Vite
2. Set up project structure with appropriate folders for components, services, etc.
3. Install necessary dependencies (axios, react-router-dom, etc.)

**Testing Exit Criteria:**

- Verify the application builds without errors
- Manually test that the application starts and renders a basic page

### Step F2: Create API Service Layer

1. Create a service layer for making API calls to the backend
2. Implement functions for getting and creating sources
3. Implement functions for getting and creating recipes

**Testing Exit Criteria:**

- Write unit tests for the API service functions using Jest mocks
- Tests should verify that API calls are made with the correct parameters and URLs

### Step F3: Create Source Management Component

1. Create a component to list existing sources
2. Create a form component for adding new sources
3. Integrate with the API service to fetch and create sources

**Testing Exit Criteria:**

- Write unit tests using React Testing Library to verify:
  - The source list component renders correctly with mock data
  - The add source form captures user input correctly
  - Form submission triggers the appropriate API call
- Manually test the component to ensure it works as expected in the browser

### Step F4: Create Recipe Form Component

1. Create a form for entering a new recipe with name, source selection, page number, and preparation time
2. Implement conditional rendering for the page number field (only show when the selected source has page numbers)
3. Implement form validation

**Testing Exit Criteria:**

- Write unit tests using React Testing Library to verify:
  - The form renders with all required fields
  - The page number field conditionally appears based on source selection
  - Form validation works as expected
  - Form submission captures all input data correctly
- Manually test the form functionality in the browser

### Step F5: Create Recipe List Component

1. Create a component to display a list of recipes with their sources
2. Implement functionality to load recipes from the API
3. Add basic styling to the list for readability

**Testing Exit Criteria:**

- Write unit tests using React Testing Library to verify:
  - The component renders a list of recipes with their sources
  - The component handles loading states correctly
  - The component displays error messages when API calls fail
- Manually test the component in the browser to ensure recipes are displayed correctly

### Step F6: Integrate Components into a Complete UI

1. Create a main application component that includes the source management, recipe form, and recipe list components
2. Implement basic navigation between components
3. Ensure components work together (e.g., after adding a new source, it should appear in the source dropdown)

**Testing Exit Criteria:**

- Write integration tests to verify:
  - Navigation between components works correctly
  - Adding a new source updates the source dropdown in the recipe form
  - Adding a new recipe updates the recipe list
- Manually test the complete UI flow to ensure all components work together as expected

## Integration Steps

### Step I1: Configure CORS and API Connection

1. Configure CORS in the backend to allow requests from the frontend
2. Update frontend API service with the correct backend URL

**Testing Exit Criteria:**

- Manually test that the frontend can successfully make API calls to the backend
- Verify that sources and recipes can be created and retrieved through the UI

### Step I2: End-to-End Testing

1. Perform manual end-to-end testing of the complete workflow
2. Test creating a source, then creating a recipe using that source, and finally viewing the recipe in the list

**Testing Exit Criteria:**

- Successfully create a new source through the UI
- Successfully create a new recipe referencing the created source
- Verify that the new recipe appears in the recipe list with the correct source information

## Deployment Steps

### Step D1: Update Docker Compose for Local Development

1. Update Docker Compose configuration to include services for backend, frontend, and PostgreSQL
2. Configure environment variables for services

**Testing Exit Criteria:**

- Verify that all services can be started using Docker Compose
- Test the complete application flow using the containerized services

Upon completing all these steps, you will have a working vertical slice of the Ice Cream Recipes application with the ability to create and view recipes and sources. The implementation follows a test-driven approach with clear exit criteria for each step.
